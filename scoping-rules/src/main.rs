// section 01. RAII( Resource Acquisition Is Initialization )

/*
// Variables in Rust do more than just hold data in the stack: they also own resources,
// e.g. Box<T> owns memory in the heap. Rust enforces RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization),
// so whenever an object goes out of scope, its destructor is called and its owned resources are freed.
//
// This behavior shields against resource leak bugs, so you'll never have to manually free memory
// or worry about memory leaks again! Here's a quick showcase:

fn create_box() {
    // allocate an integer on the heap
    let _box1 = Box::new(3i32);
    // `_box1` is destroyed here, and memory gets freed
}

fn main() {
    // allocate an integer on the heap
    let _box2 = Box::new(5i32);

    // a nested scope
    {
        // allocate
        let _box3 = Box::new(4i32);

        // `_box3` is destroyed here.
    }

    // create lots of boxes.
    // there is no need to manually free memory!
    for _ in 0u32..1_000 {
        create_box();
    }

    // `_box2` is destroyed here
}
*/

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------
// section 02. Destructor

/*
// The notion of a destructor in Rust is provided through the `Drop` trait.
// The destructor is called when the resource goes out of scope. This trait is not required
// to be implemented for every type, only implement it for your type if you require its own destructor logic.
//
// Run the below example to see how the `Drop` trait works. When the variable in the main function
// goes out of scope the custom destructor will be invoked.

struct ToDrop;

impl Drop for ToDrop {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("ToDrop is being dropped");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let _x = ToDrop;
    println!("Made a ToDrop!");
}
*/

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------
// section 03. Ownership and moves

/*
// Because variables are in charge of freeing their own resources, resources can only have one owner.
// This also prevents resources from being freed more than once. Note that not all variables own resources
//
// When doing assignments (`let x = y`) or passing function arguments by value (`foo(x)`),
// the ownership of the resources is transferred. In Rust-speak, this is known as a move.
//
// After moving resources, the previous owner can no longer be used. This avoids creating dangling pointers.
//

// this function takes ownership of the heap allocated memory
fn destroy_box(c: Box<i32>) {
    println!("destroying a box that contains {}", c);
    // `c` is destroyed and the memory  freed.
}

fn main() {
    let x = 5u32; // _Stack_ allocated.
    let y = x; // *Copy* `x` into `y` - no resources are moved;

    println!("x is {}, and y is {}", x, y); // both values can be independently used.

    let a = Box::new(5i32); // `a` is a pointer to a _Heap_ allocated integer

    println!("a contains: {}", a);

    let b = a; // *Move* `a` into `b`
               // the pointer adress of `a` is copied ( not the data ) into `b`
               // both are now pointers to the same heap allocated data, but `b` now owns it.

    // println!("a contains: {}", a); // ERROR...
    // `a` can no longer access the data, because it no longer owns the heap memory

    destroy_box(b);

    // Since the heap memory has been freed at this point, this action would
    // result in dereferencing freed memory, but it's forbidden by the compiler
    // Error! Same reason as the previous Error
    // println!("b contains: {}", b);

    // *immutable_box = 4; // mutability ERROR...

    // *Move* the box, changing the ownership and mutability

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------
// section 05. partial moves

/*
// Within the destructuring of a single variable, both by-move and by-reference pattern bindings
// can be used at the same time. Doing this will result in a partial move of the variable,
// which means that parts of the variable will be moved while other parts stay.
// In such a case, the parent variable cannot be used afterwards as a whole,
// however the parts that are only referenced (and not moved) can still be used.

    #[derive(Debug)]

// section 09. lifetimes - overview
/*

// A lifetime is a construct of the compiler (or more specifically, its borrow checker)
// uses to ensure all borrows are valid. Specifically, a variable's lifetime begins
// when it is created and ends when it is destroyed.
// While lifetimes and scopes are often referred to together, they are not the same.
//
// Take, for example, the case where we borrow a variable via `&`.
// The borrow has a lifetime that is determined by where it is declared.
// As a result, the borrow is valid as long as it ends before the lender is destroyed.
// However, the scope of the borrow is determined by where the reference is used.
//
// In the following example and in the rest of this section,
// we will see how lifetimes relate to scopes, as well as how the two differ.

// Lifetimes are annotated below with lines denoting the creation
// and destruction of each variable.
// `i` has the longest lifetime because its scope entirely encloses
// both `borrow1` and `borrow2`. The duration of `borrow1` compared
// to `borrow2` is irrelevant since they are disjoint.

fn main() {
    let i = 3;
    {
        let borrow1 = &i;

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------
// section 10. lifetimes - explicit annotation
/*
// The borrow checker uses explicit lifetime annotations to determine how long references should be valid.
// In cases where lifetimes are not elided1, Rust requires explicit annotations to determine
// what the lifetime of a reference should be.
// The syntax for explicitly annotating a lifetime uses an apostrophe character as follows:
//
// `foo<'a>``
// // `foo` has a lifetime parameter `'a`
//
// Similar to closures, using lifetimes requires generics. Additionally, this lifetime syntax indicates that
// the lifetime of `foo` may not exceed that of `'a`.
// Explicit annotation of a type has the form `&'a T` where `'a` has already been introduced.
//
// In cases with multiple lifetimes, the syntax is similar:
//
// `foo<'a, 'b>`
// // `foo` has lifetime parameters `'a` and `'b`
//
// In this case, the lifetime of foo cannot exceed that of either `'a` or `'b`.
//
// See the following example for explicit lifetime annotation in use:

// `print_refs` takes two references to `i32` which have different
// lifetimes `'a` and `'b`. These two lifetimes must both be at
// least as long as the function `print_refs`.
fn print_refs<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32) {
    println!("x is {} and y is {}", x, y);
}

// a function which takes no arguments, but has a lifetime parameter `'a`
fn failed_borrow<'a>() {
    let _x = 12;

    // let y: &'a i32 = &_x; // ERROR... `_x` does not live long enough.
    // Attempting to use the lifetime `'a` as an explicit type annotation
    // inside the function will fail because the lifetime of `&_x` is shorter
    // than that of `y`. A short lifetime cannot be coerced into a longer one.
}

fn main() {
    // create variables to be borrowed below.
    let (four, nine) = (4, 9);

    // Borrows (`&`) of both variables are passed into the function.
    print_refs(&four, &nine);
    // Any input which is borrowed must outlive the borrower.
    // In other words, the lifetime of `four` and `nine` must
    // be longer than that of `print_refs`.

    failed_borrow();
    // `failed_borrow` contains no references to force `'a` to be
    // longer than the lifetime of the function, but `'a` is longer.
    // Because the lifetime is never constrained, it defaults to `'static`.

// - any reference must have an annotated lifetime.
// - any reference being returned must have the same lifetime as an input or be static.
