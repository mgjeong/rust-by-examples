// section 01. RAII( Resource Acquisition Is Initialization )

/*
// Variables in Rust do more than just hold data in the stack: they also own resources,
// e.g. Box<T> owns memory in the heap. Rust enforces RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization),
// so whenever an object goes out of scope, its destructor is called and its owned resources are freed.
//
// This behavior shields against resource leak bugs, so you'll never have to manually free memory
// or worry about memory leaks again! Here's a quick showcase:

fn create_box() {
    // allocate an integer on the heap
    let _box1 = Box::new(3i32);
    // `_box1` is destroyed here, and memory gets freed
}

fn main() {
    // allocate an integer on the heap
    let _box2 = Box::new(5i32);

    // a nested scope
    {
        // allocate
        let _box3 = Box::new(4i32);

        // `_box3` is destroyed here.
    }

    // create lots of boxes.
    // there is no need to manually free memory!
    for _ in 0u32..1_000 {
        create_box();
    }

    // `_box2` is destroyed here
}
*/

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------
// section 02. Destructor

/*
// The notion of a destructor in Rust is provided through the `Drop` trait.
// The destructor is called when the resource goes out of scope. This trait is not required
// to be implemented for every type, only implement it for your type if you require its own destructor logic.
//
// Run the below example to see how the `Drop` trait works. When the variable in the main function
// goes out of scope the custom destructor will be invoked.

struct ToDrop;

impl Drop for ToDrop {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("ToDrop is being dropped");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let _x = ToDrop;
    println!("Made a ToDrop!");
}
*/

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------
// section 03. Ownership and moves

/*
// Because variables are in charge of freeing their own resources, resources can only have one owner.
// This also prevents resources from being freed more than once. Note that not all variables own resources
//
// When doing assignments (`let x = y`) or passing function arguments by value (`foo(x)`),
// the ownership of the resources is transferred. In Rust-speak, this is known as a move.
//
// After moving resources, the previous owner can no longer be used. This avoids creating dangling pointers.
//

// this function takes ownership of the heap allocated memory
fn destroy_box(c: Box<i32>) {
    println!("destroying a box that contains {}", c);
    // `c` is destroyed and the memory  freed.
}

fn main() {
    let x = 5u32; // _Stack_ allocated.
    let y = x; // *Copy* `x` into `y` - no resources are moved;

    println!("x is {}, and y is {}", x, y); // both values can be independently used.

    let a = Box::new(5i32); // `a` is a pointer to a _Heap_ allocated integer

    println!("a contains: {}", a);

    let b = a; // *Move* `a` into `b`
               // the pointer adress of `a` is copied ( not the data ) into `b`
               // both are now pointers to the same heap allocated data, but `b` now owns it.

    // println!("a contains: {}", a); // ERROR...
    // `a` can no longer access the data, because it no longer owns the heap memory

    destroy_box(b);

    // Since the heap memory has been freed at this point, this action would
    // result in dereferencing freed memory, but it's forbidden by the compiler
    // Error! Same reason as the previous Error
    // println!("b contains: {}", b);
}
*/

// section 04. Mutability

/*

fn main() {
    let immutable_box = Box::new(5u32);

    println!("immutable_box contains {}", immutable_box);

    // *immutable_box = 4; // mutability ERROR...

    // *Move* the box, changing the ownership and mutability
    let mut mutable_box = immutable_box;

    println!("mutable_box contains {}", mutable_box);

    *mutable_box = 4u32;

    println!("mutable_box contains {}", mutable_box);
}
*/

// ------------------------------------------------------------------------
// section 05. partial moves

/*
// Within the destructuring of a single variable, both by-move and by-reference pattern bindings
// can be used at the same time. Doing this will result in a partial move of the variable,
// which means that parts of the variable will be moved while other parts stay.
// In such a case, the parent variable cannot be used afterwards as a whole,
// however the parts that are only referenced (and not moved) can still be used.

fn main() {
    #[derive(Debug)]
    struct Person {
        name: String,
        age: Box<u8>,
    }

    let person = Person {
        name: "Alice".to_owned(),
        age: Box::new(20),
    };

    let Person { name, ref age } = person;

    println!("The person's age is {}", age);

// section 06. borrowing

/*
// Most of the time, we'd like to access data without taking ownership over it.
// To accomplish this, Rust uses a borrowing mechanism. Instead of passing objects by value (T),
// objects can be passed by reference (&T).
//
// The compiler statically guarantees (via its borrow checker) that references always point to valid objects.
// That is, while references to an object exist, the object cannot be destroyed.

// section 09. lifetimes - overview
/*
 */
// A lifetime is a construct of the compiler (or more specifically, its borrow checker)
// uses to ensure all borrows are valid. Specifically, a variable's lifetime begins
// when it is created and ends when it is destroyed.
// While lifetimes and scopes are often referred to together, they are not the same.
//
// Take, for example, the case where we borrow a variable via `&`.
// The borrow has a lifetime that is determined by where it is declared.
// As a result, the borrow is valid as long as it ends before the lender is destroyed.
// However, the scope of the borrow is determined by where the reference is used.
//
// In the following example and in the rest of this section,
// we will see how lifetimes relate to scopes, as well as how the two differ.

// Lifetimes are annotated below with lines denoting the creation
// and destruction of each variable.
// `i` has the longest lifetime because its scope entirely encloses
// both `borrow1` and `borrow2`. The duration of `borrow1` compared
// to `borrow2` is irrelevant since they are disjoint.o
fn main() {
    let i = 3;
    {
        let borrow1 = &i;
